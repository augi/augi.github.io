## Augi, the software engineer

I'm passionate software engineer, mainly focused on backend services. I'm working mainly in Scala and C#, and I'm author of few [Gradle](https://gradle.org) plugins (implemented in Groovy).

In last years, I'm using Docker and microservice architecture, and I'm practicing Continuous Integration/Deployment/Delivery.

## Docker basics workshop
As I have more than two years of developing and running applications in Docker, I offer _Docker basics workshop_ for companies. The audience is developers that have little or no knowledge of Docker. After this workshop, the developers should be able to use Docker and decide if it's good choice for a particular task (Docker is not the best choice for everything!).

The workshop lasts one day, the language is Czech, and has two main parts:
 1. Docker basics - how to run single container, how to build an image etc.
 2. Docker orchestration - introduction to Docker Compose, basic information about Marathon and Docker Swarm
