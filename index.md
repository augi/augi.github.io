## Augi, the software engineer

I'm passionate software engineer, mainly focused on backend services. I'm working mainly in Scala and C#, and I'm author of few [Gradle](https://gradle.org) plugins (implemented in Groovy).

In last yeers, I'm using Docker and microservice architecture, and I'm practicing Continuous Integration/Deployment/Delivery.
